                             	  	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">About the Program:</span> To promote economic prosperity and long-term growth, public and private partners were brought together by the Northern Virginia Workforce Investment Board to create the SSG. These partners combine their own resources with federal, state, and local dollars to deliver comprehensive employment and training services to area employers, job seekers, and youth. SkillSource Center staff provide access to free programs such as Adult Basic Education, Job Corps, English literacy and civics instruction, citizenship counseling, job skills classes, and job placement services to its clients and partners. The presence of a variety of opportunities in one location facilitates dual program enrollment for eligible clients (e.g., ESOL and pre-GED classes).<br />                                   
                                	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">Impact:</span> In Program Year 2013, the six SSG One Stop Employment Centers met or exceeded 11 benchmark measures for programs serving adults, youth, and dislocated workers. Enough clients entered the workforce to create a return on investment 4.9 times greater than the public funds used to support these programs.

                                	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">About the Program:</span> The Kansas Board of Regents' Employer Engagement initiative encourages businesses to work with local postsecondary institutions to support various levels of education and training.  After signing a "Skills Pledge," businesses work directly with local institutions and, based on their level of engagement, receive annual recognition and a certificate recognizing their level of support (i.e., Supporter, Partner, or Champion).  As a Supporter, the business must provide at least one opportunity for students such as providing a guest speaker to a college program or facility tours to instructors and students.   Businesses and their partner colleges/institutions are recognized in newsletters and on the Kansas Board of Regents website, and success stores are shared at the regional and national levels.<br />

                                	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">Purpose:</span> The goal of PluggedInVA is to provide low-skilled adults with a career pathways program that incorporates 21st Century Skills into a traditional General Educational Development (GED&#174;) curriculum to help them quickly develop the technology and workplace skills they need to succeed in a fast-paced, global economy.<br />
                             	  	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">About the Program:</span> PluggedInVA is a career pathways program that provides motivated adult learners with a contextualized GED&#174; curriculum integrated with industry-specific technical training as a means to develop essential workplace skills for entry-level jobs in targeted industries.  PluggedInVA programs last approximately six months with learners attending class from 12 to 15 hours per week. Throughout the duration of the program, learners are co-enrolled at the adult education program and a local community college, earning transferable credits and certifications related to a targeted industry. For the entirety of the program, they will engage in learning activities to hone digital literacy skills, professional soft skills, workplace readiness skills, as well as basic skills. The curriculum progresses from a focus on strengthening basic skills and preparing for the GED&#174; test to a focus on 21st century skills, culminating in a capstone project that demonstrates their mastery of all core instructional elements.<br />                                   
                                	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">Impact:</span> The first cohort in Southwest Virginia focused on the technology skills learners would need for local technology-sector jobs with CGI and Northrup Grumman. Since then, PluggedInVA cohorts have continued to run in a range of high-growth and high-wage industries, including construction/weatherization, entrepreneurship, health, electronic medical records, electrician helper, and manufacturing. The model continues to expand both to a wider range of targeted industries and to other regions across the state.

                             	  	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">About the Program:</span> The Training &amp; Upgrading Fund was created by collective bargaining agreements between District 1 199C of the National Union of Hospital &amp; Healthcare Employees, AFL-CIO, and nine Philadelphia hospitals in 1974. Under the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act, the parties agreed to create the Fund to provide educational benefits to union members and the community. The basic benefit of the Fund is a Full Time Scholarship Program, which allows workers an educational leave, pays tuition costs up to $10,000 per year, provides a cost-of-living stipend, and continues all benefits. There is a Tuition Reimbursement Program, which pays for courses up to $5,000 a year. The Continuing Education benefit provides all of the educational programs offered by the Breslin Learning Center operated by the Training Fund.

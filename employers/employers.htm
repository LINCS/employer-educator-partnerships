                <p>Ensuring robust economic growth, a thriving middle class, and broadly shared prosperity will require a significant expansion of the skills and knowledge of American workers over the next few decades. American employers have a crucial role to play (beyond serving as advisors) in "upskilling" the workforce&#8212;eliminating the gap between current workforce skills and projected workforce needs.

                <p>To address this challenge, employers can:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
        	        	<li>Help identify gaps in workforce skills within their industry and determine labor market training needs.</li>
                		<li>Engage with educational and training organizations to build career pathways and create pipelines of skilled talent to meet labor market needs.</li>
                 		<li>Work in collaboration with companies in the same industry sector (for example, health care, manufacturing, construction, information technology) or geographic region to improve existing education and training programs.</li>
                		<li>Partner with job-driven training programs that integrate hands-on work experience with classroom learning to help individuals learn and advance more quickly. </li>                    
   	            </ul>

                <p>Employer engagement includes providing direct resources for on-the job training, mentoring, apprenticeships, and internships for those wishing to improve their skills. Flexible scheduling and tuition assistance can also enable employees to improve their skills without interrupting their work.

                <ol>
                	<li>A shortage of skilled workers to help employers expand their businesses.</li>
                	<li>A lack of clarity about what skills these jobs require.</li>
                	<li>Uncertainty of hard-working Americans about what job-related skills to pursue and whether work opportunities will be available when they finish.</li>

                	<li>Provide stepping stones for low-wage, entry-level workers to more productive employment.</li>
                    <li>Link education/training and workforce development to labor market trends and needs.</li>

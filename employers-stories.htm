                                	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">Purpose:</span> 12 For Life is a one of a kind program to help at-risk youth graduate from high school and make successful transitions to work and post-secondary education. Through contextualized work-based learning, a robust support system, and a paycheck, Southwire's 12 for Life program gives at-risk students a pathway to success by enabling them to complete 12 years of school while meeting Southwire's high production standards and filling the company's talent needs. <br />
                             	  	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">About the Program:</span> Southwire is a privately held wire and cable manufacturer headquartered in Georgia. The 12 for Life program allows students to combine a four-hour shift at a specially designed plant, with a work schedule built around their academic class requirements. At the 12 for Life plant, students rotate among workstations so they gain experience in the entire manufacturing process. They also earn two high school credits per semester. Materials the students manufacture wind up at large distributors across the country.<br />                                   
                                	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">Impact:</span> 12 for Life has been successful for the students and for Southwire. For the company, 12 for Life is self-sustaining. The facility does some of the same work as Southwire's other plants, and productivity rates are high. The 12 for Life program is also a talent source: Southwire has hired 15 percent of the program graduates as full-time employees. The overall graduation rate in Carroll County has increased approximately 10 percent since the program began, while 39 percent of graduates have moved on to postsecondary education &#8212; a number Southwire considers very successful since 12 for Life participants are selected in part because they are likely to drop out of high school.

                                <span class = "resourceList_Bold">Purpose:</span> Founded in 1960, Bison Gear &amp; Engineering Corp. is a designer and manufacturer of horsepower electric motors, gear motors, and gear reducers based in St. Charles, IL. The company provides a number of different National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)-endorsed opportunities for certification and higher education learning for its employees in order to better equip them for careers in manufacturing.<br />
                           	  	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">About the Program:</span> Bison Gear has established continuing education as an essential part of its work culture. The company requires basic certifications (National Career Readiness Certificate) of its production floor workers, and all are encouraged to get at least an associate's degree. Continuing education opportunities for new and incumbent Bison Gear employees under the Skilled Workforce Initiative include:
                                    <ul>
										<li>National Career Readiness Certificate <a href = "http://www.act.org/products/workforce-act-national-career-readiness-certificate/" target = "_blank">(http://www.act.org/products/workforce-act-national-career-readiness-certificate/)</a>, a portable credential that demonstrates achievement and a level of workplace employability skills in applied mathematics, location information, and reading for information.

										<li>MSSC <a href = "http://www.msscusa.org" target = "_blank">(www.msscusa.org)</a>, a national, industry-led, training, assessment, and certification system focused on the core skills and knowledge needed by the nation's front-line production and material-handling workers.

                               	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">Impact:</span> Bison Gear has created a corporate culture that values learning, with over a third of its employees involved in some level of continuing education or training.  The average on-the-job training hours per employee over the past three years is 11 hours. Safety and productivity have been positively affected as well. Currently, six employees are taking advantage of Bison's tuition assistance by attending one of the regional community colleges to obtain associate's degrees, while six others have moved from associate's to bachelor's degrees.

                                <span class = "resourceList_Bold">Purpose:</span> Choice Scholars invites students whose placement scores are just below the cusp of college readiness to a four-week program to help them develop skills in identified areas of weakness. Motorola Solutions joined the Choice Scholars Summer Institute at Harper College to provide lunch-and-learn opportunities, called Motorola Moments. Begun in 2011, these weekly lunches provide Choice Scholars students the opportunity to learn directly from Motorola Solutions employees. <br />
                           	  	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">About the Program:</span> Harper College, a community college in Palatine, Illinois, operates the Choice Scholars Summer Institute, an academic and professional development program available to incoming freshmen from communities surrounding Harper College. The Choice Scholars Summer Program offers students an individualized study plan that will assist them in testing into college level courses. Students work with Harper College faculty and staff to gain technical proficiency and learn about various industries, culminating in a research symposium at the end of the four-week program. At the end of the program, students re-test on the college placement exams with the goal of placing into college-level courses and bypassing remediation.  This program helps students avoid spending time and money on courses that will not count toward their college degrees and could potentially delay degree completion. <br />                                                               
                               	<span class = "resourceList_Bold">Impact:</span> Students learn directly from professionals about the challenges and rewards of various career paths, helping them develop a professional identity and make informed decisions about their future careers. The program involves 30 students each year and has achieved a 72% reduction in the students' need for development (remedial) courses and has seen a regular course retention rate of 96% from Fall to Spring semesters.
